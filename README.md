# Local-Food-Wastage-Management-System
Food wastage is a major issue that affects food security and environmental sustainability. A large amount of edible food is wasted daily by restaurants, grocery stores, and households, while many people face food shortages.

This project, Local Food Wastage Management System, aims to reduce food wastage by providing a platform where food providers can list surplus food and receivers can view and claim it. The system is developed using Streamlit for the user interface and SQLite for database management. CRUD operations are implemented to manage food listings, providers, receivers, and claims efficiently. The application also supports filtering and data visualization to improve usability.


PROBLEM STATEMENT-Food wastage occurs due to lack of coordination between food providers and people in need. Excess food from restaurants, supermarkets, and catering services is often discarded due to the absence of an efficient management system.

There is a need for a simple and effective application that:

Reduces food wastage

Connects food providers with receivers

Tracks food listings and claims

Provides transparency and easy access to information


CONCLUSION-The Local Food Wastage Management System successfully provides a platform to reduce food wastage by connecting food providers and receivers. By implementing CRUD operations and database integration, the system ensures efficient food management and transparency. The project demonstrates practical application of database concepts, Python programming, and web-based interfaces using Streamlit.
